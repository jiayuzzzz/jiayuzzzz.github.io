# PCA method by Stata
#### _Data source: Statistics Sweden(SCB)_ 
We are going to use the demographic data after normalization. The analysis is used for my master thesis named "The Impact of Swedish Public Finance Factors on the Local Real Estate Market â€” Based on the GMM PVAR Approach" at KTH. The codes tutorial comes from [Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis in Stata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNTsAVj0t7U) by econometricsacademy.

we should choose two main components based on the eigenvalues >1. They can explain about 67% variance of the data.

The linear equations are:


_C1 = 0.3930*pop_den - 0.4384*tax + 0.5171*edu_rate - 0.1110*inmi_rate + 0.3728*employ_rate + 0.4845*dipo_inc_

_C2 = 0.3553*pop_den - 0.2353*tax + 0.0298*edu_rate + 0.7907*inmi_rate - 0.4382*employ_rate - 0.0146*dipo_inc_
